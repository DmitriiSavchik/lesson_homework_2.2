            <h1 class="hobby">MUSIC</h1>
            <p>Music is my everything. I think that it is one of the most important things in my life. You know - a man can`t live without music - just like a flower without sun.
                Not everybody can find something beautiful in things which seem to be weird, awful and ugly in some ways. My favorite kind of music is hevy metal, and not everybody can listen to it. But for me it is the best music.
                Some years ago, just about three or four, my favourite music was rap. I enjoyed listening to it and being a rapper - wide jeans, long t-shirts and shiny chains, you know. 
                But then I started to feel rather boringabout it - I just needed something really fresh.
                And one day I found a very interesting song while surfing the Internet. The name of this song was "Betonomeshalka" and the band who had played it was Sledgehammer.
