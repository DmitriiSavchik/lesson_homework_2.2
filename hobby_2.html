            <h1 class="hobby">DANCE</h1>
            <p>For me life is a dance. I cannot imagine myself without it. Every movement, swing, turn, makes the world brighter.
                I have been dancing since I was 5. And it is passion of my life. At first, I danced ballroom dancers. It is very beautiful and elegant. Dress, heels, hair - what could be more beautiful?
                 Before going on a stage, you feel excitement. But once the music starts to play, once there is a great desire to come out and shows to all that you are capable. And exit. Crowds of people are watching your every movement, a smile. And it is a true happiness.
